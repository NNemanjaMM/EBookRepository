# EBookRepository
EBookRepository is a web application that enables book storage and search

This application gives user a chance to store documents online, search through them and download them, depending of it's role. 
Three different roles are implemented:
* Visitor (does not require login)
* Subscriber
* Administrator

First one has the ability to search through the documents and list them, but not to download them. Subscriber would can 
search through the documents, download them and update his account. Administrator has the highest privileges, he is trusted to
do everything that subscriber can. Furthermore, he can add, update and remove books, manage book categories and subscribers list.

## Motivation
This system is created as student project for Managing digital documents course. Purpouse of this project is to learn basics of 
managing and searchig digital documents. Satisfactory final project would make me pass the exam, which is also important. 
Good UI design should make this web application user-friendly.
